Bank Marketing Dataset – Decision Tree Classifier
Observations and Insights:

1. Objective:
   The goal was to predict whether a client would subscribe to a term deposit based on various features such as age, job, marital status, education, etc., using a Decision Tree Classifier.

2. Who is more likely to subscribe?
   - Clients with jobs such as "student", "retired", and "entrepreneur" showed higher conversion rates.
   - People with higher education levels had better chances of subscribing.
   - Clients who were contacted during the months of May, June, August, and October had higher response rates.
   - Those who were contacted via cellular performed better than those contacted via telephone.
   - If the client had been contacted in a previous campaign and the outcome was "success", they were much more likely to subscribe again.

3. Features highly correlated with subscription:
   - `poutcome` (previous marketing outcome)
   - `month` (last contact month)
   - `contact` (contact communication type)
   - `education` (education level)
   - `job` (type of job)
   - `duration` (duration of the call) – this was removed during modeling to avoid data leakage but was highly predictive.

4. Impact of categorical features:
   - **Job**: Students and retired individuals were more likely to subscribe compared to blue-collar and unemployed clients.
   - **Marital Status**: Single clients had a slightly higher chance of subscribing than married clients.
   - **Loan Status**: Clients without personal loans were more likely to subscribe.
   - **Education**: Those with tertiary education or unknown education levels showed better responses than those with only primary education.

5. Model Performance:
   - The Decision Tree model performed reasonably well, giving insights into which attributes are more important.
   - Feature importance showed that `poutcome`, `contact`, and `month` were among the top contributors.
   - Decision Trees are easy to visualize and interpret, making it suitable for this type of marketing analysis.

6. Final Conclusion:
   The model helped identify key factors influencing a client’s decision to subscribe to a term deposit. The insights can guide marketing strategies by focusing on the most responsive segments of customers and optimizing campaign timing and communication method.
